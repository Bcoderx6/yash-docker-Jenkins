Through this beginner project, I mastered building a smooth Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using Jenkins, SonarQube, and Docker. I also learned how to connect with cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure and AWS for deploying my projects. By focusing on DevOps principles, automation, and containerization, I enhanced code quality with static analysis. This hands-on experience in CI/CD practices and cloud integration sets a strong foundation for my journey into the world of DevOps.
